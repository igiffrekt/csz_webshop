<current_state>
Working on Phase 10 (Design, Migration & Launch). Started implementing design with WooCommerce integration directly (outside formal plan execution). Homepage now pulls live products and categories from WooCommerce store (csz.wedopixels.hu).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**WooCommerce Integration (ad-hoc, not in formal plans):**
- Created `apps/web/src/lib/woocommerce.ts` - Full WooCommerce REST API client
- Functions: `getWooProducts`, `getWooProductsWithPagination`, `getWooProduct`, `getWooCategories`, `getWooCategoryTree`, `transformWooProduct`
- Homepage (`/[locale]/page.tsx`) now fetches from WooCommerce instead of Strapi
- Products page (`/termekek`) uses WooCommerce with pagination from headers
- Product detail page (`/termekek/[slug]`) uses WooCommerce lookup by slug

**HeroSection Updates:**
- Vertical category menu shows WooCommerce categories
- Categories with children prioritized at top (Osztók, Szerelvényszekrények, Tűzcsapok)
- Subcategory dropdown slides out to the right on hover
- Custom icons from `/public/icons/`:
  - `katergoria-menu-icon.svg` - menu header grid icon
  - `nav_arrow_icon.svg` - category chevron arrows
  - `icon_arrow.svg` - carousel next button
- Arrow button in hero uses circular black button with custom arrow

**CategoryGrid Updates:**
- Shows actual product counts from WooCommerce

**Note:** Some work done ad-hoc may overlap with plans 10-03, 10-04, 10-11

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **WooCommerce direct integration**: Using WooCommerce REST API directly from Next.js instead of migrating to Strapi first
- **Store**: csz.wedopixels.hu with credentials in `.env.local`
- **Category tree logic**: Fetch all categories, filter children by parent ID, show children with products only
- **Dropdown position**: Slides out to the right (not down) matching design reference
- **Custom icons**: Using SVGs from `/public/icons/` instead of Lucide icons for brand consistency
- **Category prioritization**: Categories with children sorted to top of vertical menu

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None currently
- Dev server runs on port 3001 (port 3000 sometimes occupied)

<context>
User wanted to quickly see live WooCommerce products on homepage before going through formal Phase 10 plans. We integrated WooCommerce directly, fixed pagination, product detail pages, category counts, and dropdown menus. The work done may accelerate Phase 10 execution since WooCommerce integration is largely complete.

The design implementation follows reference images in `.planning/research/` directory. Phase 10 plans have detailed implementation specs.

When resuming:
1. Run `/gsd:resume-work` to restore context
2. Review Phase 10 plans to see what's covered by ad-hoc work
3. Continue with `/gsd:execute-phase` for remaining Phase 10 work
4. Or manually execute specific plans that weren't covered

Start dev server: `cd apps/web && pnpm dev`
</next_action>

<environment>
- WooCommerce URL: https://csz.wedopixels.hu
- API credentials in `apps/web/.env.local`
- Dev server: http://localhost:3001 (or 3000)
- PostgreSQL: Docker container (may need `docker compose up -d`)
</environment>
